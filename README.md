# prog_language_kappa_
This was a project (Dated: July 2024) that I undertook during the summer before college. Decided to delve into building an interpreter.
As a bonus, I got my own language that I can code in (not that I would).

Note: This was done without much knowledge about compilers, interpreters etc. The fundamental logic is rather rudimentary.
It is not meant to be taken as reference or be used except for fun.
